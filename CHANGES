stringhelpers Changelog
=======================

Version 1.3
-----------
Improves the `def reverse()` function.
- Will return a copy of `string` with all the words in a reversed order as
  long as the given `string` is a str or unicode object - otherwise it will be
  returned unchanged.

Improves the `reverse_order()` function.
- Will now also reverse the order of items in lists and dictionaries,
  not only the order of words in strings.


Version 1.2
-----------
Improves the `upcase_first_letter` function.
- Any non-alphanumeric chars and spaces will now not be treated as the first letter,
  which stopped the search after the first letter that should be capitalized.


Version 1.1
-----------
Fixes small typos.


Version 1.0
-----------
First release.
